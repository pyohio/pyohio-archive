Why do we still have trouble going from learning to doing? With limited time to pick up the new things that will advance our careers, what's the most efficient way to retain and implement the new skills that we need? Taking lessons from adult learning theory and from examples of hundreds of bootcamp students, this talk will walk through what I have learned about accelerated adult learning and tell you the what and the why around techniques that you can use to more efficiently pick up your next technology in record time.</p>\n<p>There has been substantial research done on how adults learn, but they aren't widely known. Using the same learning tactics you used as a kid doesn't always bring the best results or results that will stick. Adults shouldn't be aiming to memorize facts for a test, they should be looking to build long term skills that they can apply when needed.</p>\n<p>This talk will pass on some of the most important and actionable findings in adult learning research and will walk attendees through a path to learning a new skill that is efficient and effective.</p>\n<p>Topics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Dreyfus Model of Learning</li>\n<li>How learning shifts between the novice and the intermediate</li>\n<li>Understanding the levels of mastery</li>\n<li>The Effective Tech Bootcamp model of learning</li>\n<li>What learning techniques are effective and why</li>\n<li>Creating a learning plan that works for you</li>\n</ul>","feedback_url":"https://pyohio.typeform.com/to/wBj0Xy","kind":"30-minute Talk","schedule":{"room":"Cartoon 1","start":"2019-07-27T16:30:00"},"speakers":[{"name":"Joe Erickson","speaker_id":210,"photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/e0596e570086a004bdd5fa9529f3b7cb/d092e/210.png","srcSet":"/2019/static/e0596e570086a004bdd5fa9529f3b7cb/d092e/210.png 1x"}}}}}],"youtube_url":"http://youtu.be/RewDPZrgRls"},"tutorials":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"bde03e78-3e21-5bae-8be9-9a842b5e7b2a"}}
