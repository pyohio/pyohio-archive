{"data":{"talks":{"title":"A/V Streaming Workflow in Python","description_html":"<p>A/V Streaming has been used widely but being able to manipulate the stream on your custom requirements has always been challenging. We discuss how we can overcome with this challenge and build custom streaming pipeline with the help of open source multimedia framework and Python libraries for Gst, Gib, and GObject.</p>","abstract_html":"<p>If you are into the live stream, podcast or planning to stream live you might come across different platforms like Periscope, YouTube Live, Facebook Live, etc.,  where you can log in and start your live streaming. However, when it comes to manipulating your streams, these platforms donâ€™t have that functionality exposed to end users. On top of this, these platforms are one to one streaming platforms; there is not an easy way to broadcast your stream directly to multiple platforms. In this talk, we will talk about how we can create an application to capture gameplay/screen content, manipulate your stream, record the captured content locally, and stream it on different streaming platforms concurrently.</p>","feedback_url":"https://pyohio.typeform.com/to/m2eoV7","kind":"30-minute Talk","schedule":{"room":"Hays Cape","start":"2019-07-28T16:15:00"},"speakers":[{"name":"Shishir Pokharel","speaker_id":202,"photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/56fe2dd28e259625572d8c00fb2a9aa1/481ca/202.jpg","srcSet":"/2019/static/56fe2dd28e259625572d8c00fb2a9aa1/481ca/202.jpg 1x,\n/2019/static/56fe2dd28e259625572d8c00fb2a9aa1/05ba8/202.jpg 1.5x,\n/2019/static/56fe2dd28e259625572d8c00fb2a9aa1/73cd1/202.jpg 2x"}}}}}],"youtube_url":"http://youtu.be/XYZ--owG7dg"},"tutorials":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"7ddbb3bb-2714-5373-ad04-82c02281b648"}}
