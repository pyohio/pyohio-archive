Never fear! Let’s learn how to write robust, scalable Web UI tests using Python, pytest, and Selenium WebDriver that cover the full stack for any Web app.</p>","abstract_html":"<p>Unit tests are a great way to start Web app testing and automation, but the buck doesn’t stop there. Black-box feature tests that interact with the app like a user are just as important. They catch things unit tests cannot. The challenge is that Web UI tests are complicated and notoriously unreliable. So, how can we write tests well?</p>\n<p>In this tutorial, we’ll cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using Python 3, pytest, and Selenium WebDriver to write tests like a pro</li>\n<li>Modeling Web UI interactions with page objects</li>\n<li>Deciding what should and should not be tested with automation</li>\n<li>Improving the solution to scale higher</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tutorial will include lecture segments intertwined with hands-on coding exercises. We will write tests together for the DuckDuckGo website.</p>\n<p>After this tutorial, you’ll be able to write battle-hardened Web UI tests for any Web app, including Django and Flask apps. You will also have a test automation project that can be the starting point for any Web UI tests.</p>","feedback_url":"https://pyohio.typeform.com/to/DqJi8Q","kind":"120-minute Tutorial","prerequisite_setup_html":"<p>All prerequisites and setup instructions can be found in the README of the tutorial project:\nhttps://github.com/AndyLPK247/pyohio-2019-web-ui-testing</p>\n<p>Please follow these instructions and then clone the repository onto your machine.
