{"data":{"talks":{"title":"The Mediocre Programmer","description_html":"<p>Mediocre Programmers? What is that? Shouldn't we want to be great programmers instead? In this talk we'll discuss what it means to be a mediocre programmer. We'll consider the many pitfalls that may befall you on your journey, from self-doubt to burnout, and share tips for how to cope with the challenges of programming and when it might be time to try something new.</p>","abstract_html":"<p>This talk is highlights from a book that I'm writing about the journey of being a mediocre programmer. Beginners tend to get all of the love, and advanced programmers get all of the respect and glory. But we don't have much for helping intermediate programmers. We don't tend to consider how difficult it can be to work through the exuberance of beginning programming (where everything is new, fresh, and exciting) into becoming better programmers. We're just expected to figure things out on our own. This talk draws on my experiences of being a mediocre programmer and gives advice and tips on how to become better programmers. We'll cover how to find a group of traveling companions, how to focus on learning one thing at a time, and how to deal with the struggles of our emotions and self doubt. We'll also cover examining our emotions and understanding when the spark that drew us to programming is truly burned out.</p>","feedback_url":"https://pyohio.typeform.com/to/b4I1ZE","kind":"30-minute Talk","schedule":{"room":"Cartoon 1","start":"2019-07-28T13:45:00"},"speakers":[{"name":"Craig Maloney","speaker_id":231,"photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/e71f071edf980bcc9894d2af4fa4a903/d092e/231.png","srcSet":"/2019/static/e71f071edf980bcc9894d2af4fa4a903/d092e/231.png 1x,\n/2019/static/e71f071edf980bcc9894d2af4fa4a903/b172e/231.png 1.5x"}}}}}],"youtube_url":"http://youtu.be/XNwOnRmCqZ0"},"tutorials":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"808b9ef9-28c7-5a18-b1bd-ebcbb3d0882f"}}
