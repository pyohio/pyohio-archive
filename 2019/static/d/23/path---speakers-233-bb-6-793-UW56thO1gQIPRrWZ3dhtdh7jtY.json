{"data":{"speakers":{"biography_html":"<p>Kattni works as an embedded software developer, hardware designer, technical writer, and open source community leader working with Adafruit. She is proud to be a woman in tech. Her journey creating things began at an early age in her dad’s extensive workshop in the basement. Kattni’s foray into the amazing world of open source, electronics, and programming began two years ago — that her desk has become a mess of wires and circuit boards, soldering irons and computers is still unbelievably exciting. In the rest of her life, she is a maker, creator, programmer, artist, photographer, one-time gardener, and loved partner. She is tolerated by two cats who continue to let her live with them.</p>","name":"Kattni Rembor","photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/363af254b37854832184e04b146a371d/481ca/233.jpg","srcSet":"/2019/static/363af254b37854832184e04b146a371d/481ca/233.jpg 1x,\n/2019/static/363af254b37854832184e04b146a371d/05ba8/233.jpg 1.5x,\n/2019/static/363af254b37854832184e04b146a371d/73cd1/233.jpg 2x"}}}},"presentations":[{"kind":"Keynote","title":"Changing Lives through Open Source, Passion and Mentoring","presentation_id":126}],"twitter":"kattni","mastodon":"","website":""}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2f057b40-eb4b-55f5-bcf7-c33e75f6ddab"}}
