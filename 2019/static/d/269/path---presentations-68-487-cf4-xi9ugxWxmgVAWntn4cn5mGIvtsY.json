I'm sure many of you have used the wonderful <a href=\"https://ipython.org\">ipython</a> interactive Python shell which is a good example of a CLI.  Python has the built-in <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html\">cmd</a> library for creating CLIs, but it is extremely bare-bones.  The <a href=\"https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2\">cmd2</a> package is a batteries-included extension of <code>cmd</code> which makes it much quicker and easier to create feature-rich and user-friendly CLIs.</p>\n<p>The presentation will first explain how to install <code>cmd2</code>.  The talk will next show how to create a basic <code>cmd2</code> application.  Then the talk will progressively add features to this application while demonstrating the capabilities built into <code>cmd2</code>.  In the end, the presentation will show how to build a basic but feature-rich and user-friendly CLI application from scratch. This application will include many features which make it easy to use for customers, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built-in help</li>\n<li>Top-notch tab-completion</li>\n<li>Shell-like functionality including ability to run shell commands, pipe to shell commands, and redirect output to files</li>\n<li>Built-in application scripting</li>\n<li>Built-in Python scripting</li>\n<li>Built-in history</li>\n<li>Command aliases and macros</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, people who attend this talk will learn how to use the Python programming language with the <code>cmd2</code> package to quickly and efficiently build their own interactive command-line applications.</p>","feedback_url":"https://pyohio.typeform.com/to/is8CtM","kind":"45-minute Talk","schedule":{"room":"Hays Cape","start":"2019-07-27T14:00:00"},"speakers":[{"name":"Todd Leonhardt","speaker_id":204,"photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/586971fea1ddd515925b6605b91b2e7a/481ca/204.jpg","srcSet":"/2019/static/586971fea1ddd515925b6605b91b2e7a/481ca/204.jpg 1x,\n/2019/static/586971fea1ddd515925b6605b91b2e7a/05ba8/204.jpg 1.5x,\n/2019/static/586971fea1ddd515925b6605b91b2e7a/73cd1/204.jpg 2x"}}}}},{"name":"Kevin Van Brunt","speaker_id":222,"photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/4c49f621f74a0880939bc00d16db9123/481ca/222.jpg","srcSet":"/2019/static/4c49f621f74a0880939bc00d16db9123/481ca/222.jpg 1x,\n/2019/static/4c49f621f74a0880939bc00d16db9123/05ba8/222.jpg 1.5x"}}}}}],"youtube_url":"http://youtu.be/pebeWrTqIIw"},"tutorials":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"6024da28-deb8-5a46-9d8a-26bfbd230f62"}}
