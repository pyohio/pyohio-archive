{"data":{"talks":{"title":"The Value of Docstrings","description_html":"<p>Docstrings are a common convention in Python programming, but\ntheir value may be taken for granted. In the absence of docstrings, schools of thought on writing effective code involve using many comments or using few if any comments. I will\nargue that docstrings improve upon these approaches, and then explore how they can positively impact encapsulation, testing, documentation, and design.</p>","abstract_html":"<p>Python docstrings differ from regular comments in that they are stored\nas an attribute of a callable object and are accessible through the\nhelp() builtin function. However, their importance in writing\nreadable and maintainable python modules has very little to do with their\ntechnical language features in Python, and much more to do with the\ndiscipline they bring to effective documentation.</p>\n<p>Any new developer will encounter well reasoned advice on the need to\ncomprehensively comment their code, and contrary but equally reasonable advice\nto avoid using comments at all by writing better code. This talk will briefly\nexplore these viewpoints, and then review the standard conventions for Python\ndocstrings. I argue that the consistent and conventional use\nof Python docstrings results in more readable and maintainable code than\nthat written with only unstructured comments, independent of how sparse or\nplentiful those comments may be.</p>\n<p>Additional areas of improvement in software design are discussed, including\neffective encapsulation, the difficulty of naming methods, \"docstring driven\ndevelopment\", extension into external documentation, and integration with testing.\nFinally, I argue that Python\ndocstring conventions are a model for improved software design in general,\nand are worth adopting even in other languages that do not necessarily\nsupport actual docstrings.</p>","feedback_url":"https://pyohio.typeform.com/to/FYPsAj","kind":"30-minute Talk","schedule":{"room":"Barbie Tootle","start":"2019-07-27T15:45:00"},"speakers":[{"name":"Eric Appelt","speaker_id":85,"photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/c28342952f62220fc794f8fa4319e932/481ca/85.jpg","srcSet":"/2019/static/c28342952f62220fc794f8fa4319e932/481ca/85.jpg 1x,\n/2019/static/c28342952f62220fc794f8fa4319e932/05ba8/85.jpg 1.5x,\n/2019/static/c28342952f62220fc794f8fa4319e932/73cd1/85.jpg 2x"}}}}}],"youtube_url":"http://youtu.be/fl8baeAa3uI"},"tutorials":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c0095f6e-b619-5f9f-adf9-4cb5c6eaf8d9"}}
