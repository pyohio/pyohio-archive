{"data":{"talks":{"title":"Let's Build an ORM","description_html":"<p>Applications rely on data, and relational databases are a convenient way to organize structured information. Object-relational mappers like SQLAlchemy and Django’s ORM are complex libraries, but they aren’t black magic. De-mystify some of the magic as we build the basics of an ORM in under an hour.</p>","abstract_html":"<p>The presentation will start with some background on the requirements and relational databases. Next, we’ll build a basic ORM that allows creating simple tables and inserting, querying, and (if we have time) deleting records. Finally, the talk will cover some of the challenges of building a production-grade ORM, including caching, transactions, supporting multiple dialects, and we’ll briefly discuss security implications of ORMs, including SQL injection. Attendees will leave with a greater appreciation for the inner workings of the ORMs that are used on a daily basis, while understanding the challenges that go into building one.</p>","feedback_url":"https://pyohio.typeform.com/to/xC5Ixp","kind":"45-minute Talk","schedule":{"room":"Hays Cape","start":"2019-07-28T15:15:00"},"speakers":[{"name":"Greg Back","speaker_id":236,"photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/aaf9a57ef0f038dc2bebf5d29ecd5128/481ca/236.jpg","srcSet":"/2019/static/aaf9a57ef0f038dc2bebf5d29ecd5128/481ca/236.jpg 1x,\n/2019/static/aaf9a57ef0f038dc2bebf5d29ecd5128/05ba8/236.jpg 1.5x,\n/2019/static/aaf9a57ef0f038dc2bebf5d29ecd5128/73cd1/236.jpg 2x"}}}}}],"youtube_url":"http://youtu.be/6rw0p9AOYb8"},"tutorials":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"932d54e7-0157-547b-bc04-7ac1c50f59ea"}}
