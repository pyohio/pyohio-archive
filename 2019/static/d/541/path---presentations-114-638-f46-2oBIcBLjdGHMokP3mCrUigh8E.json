You won't become a full-fledged\nPython programmer, but you'll learn enough to get through PyOhio productively,\nand you'll know how to continue your own Python education afterward.</p>","abstract_html":"<p>You came to a conference for a programming language you don't know.\nGood for you!  Your courage and curiosity will pay off.  Let's teach\nyou enough Python to get you started, and enough Python concepts to\nhelp you understand the PyOhio goodness you're about to witness.</p>\n<p>We'll devote about an hour to hands-on learning of the basics of\nwriting Python programs, and an hour to understanding more advanced\nideas and terminology in general terms.  Prepare for creative analogies\nand physical demonstrations that may or may not involve interpretive\ndance.</p>\n<p>Suitable for non-programmers as well as programmers who don't know\nPython.  We'll tune the pace on the fly to the needs of those who\nactually attend, but if there's a mix, the least experienced will\nget highest priority.</p>\n<p>Bring a laptop!</p>","feedback_url":"https://pyohio.typeform.com/to/nsC7uo","kind":"120-minute Tutorial","prerequisite_setup_html":"<p>None.</p>","schedule":{"room":"Suzanne Scharer","start":"2019-07-27T10:30:00"},"speakers":[{"name":"Catherine Devlin","speaker_id":213,"photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/75707ced928b5b04568e31d368a1d771/481ca/213.jpg","srcSet":"/2019/static/75707ced928b5b04568e31d368a1d771/481ca/213.jpg 1x,\n/2019/static/75707ced928b5b04568e31d368a1d771/05ba8/213.jpg 1.5x"}}}}}],"youtube_url":"http://youtu.be/jOvajURGPRU"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f8185da7-4393-5346-8b52-4ea468d78186"}}
