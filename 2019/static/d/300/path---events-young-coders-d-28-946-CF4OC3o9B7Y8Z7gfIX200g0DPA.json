Students are also welcome to bring their own lunch if they don't want pizza.</p>\n<p>It's the same class as taught at PyCon! Details: <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2017/events/letslearnpython/\">https://us.pycon.org/2017/events/letslearnpython/</a></p>\n<p>Except there's one slight difference: At the end of our class, the kids take everything home but the monitors: Pi, case, power supply, keyboard, mouse, and HDMI cable. They can plug into a flat screen TV and keep on learning.</p>\n<p>The class is open to teens from 12-17, and is aimed at kids who have never programmed before. (Seriously, if they are already doing this stuff at home on their own, they'll be bored.)</p>\n<p>Exceptions to to the age policy may only be made in advance by the PyOhio Chair in consultation with the class instructor. Exceptions will only be made for children under 12 if they will be entering the 7th grade (US school system) or higher in fall of 2016. Exceptions will only be made for persons over 17 if they have not yet graduated high school (12th grade US school system). Proof of education level may be required. </p>\n<p>Contact info@pyohio.org if you have questions about this policy.</p>\n<h3>Previous Sessions</h3>\n<p>Additional info on Young Coders and previous classes is available here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://pycon.blogspot.com/2013/03/how-kids-stole-show-young-coders.html\">YC at PyCon</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.trinket.io/young-coders-tutorial/\">Interview with Katie Cunningham</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://therealkatie.net/teaching/\">Katie's Teaching</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Young Coders"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"0c0598f1-a33a-50a8-97ab-161e57472f38"}}
