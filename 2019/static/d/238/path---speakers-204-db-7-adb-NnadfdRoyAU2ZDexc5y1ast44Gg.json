Currently a developer at Amazon Web Services (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com\">AWS</a>): we offer IT infrastructure services to businesses and individuals.

Recently I have enjoyed contributing to the open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2\">cmd2</a> project.</p>","name":"Todd Leonhardt","photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/586971fea1ddd515925b6605b91b2e7a/481ca/204.jpg","srcSet":"/2019/static/586971fea1ddd515925b6605b91b2e7a/481ca/204.jpg 1x,\n/2019/static/586971fea1ddd515925b6605b91b2e7a/05ba8/204.jpg 1.5x,\n/2019/static/586971fea1ddd515925b6605b91b2e7a/73cd1/204.jpg 2x"}}}},"presentations":[{"kind":"45-minute Talk","title":"A Hands-On Guide to Building Interactive Command-Line Apps with cmd2","presentation_id":68}],"twitter":"","mastodon":"","website":"https://github.com/tleonhardt"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"fdb54c31-1136-5925-821e-d79e2763a5a9"}}
