It has applications navigation, automated inspection, assisting the visually impaired, and so much more. In this talk, I will explain and demonstrate how you can use Computer Vision to locate and identify a playing card in a live video feed.</p>","abstract_html":"<p>\"Pick a card, any card,\" the magician prompts you fanning out a deck of cards. You select a card, note its value, and hand it back to the magician. They do some sleight of hand, make the card disappear into the deck, and then make it reappear. You confirm that it is, indeed, your original card. The magician moves on and you get to go back to enjoying your dinner.</p>\n<p>Where is the real magic? Is it in the magician's ability to make a card reappear? Or, is it something that many of us take for granted each and every day? In the very instant you glance at a card, you're able to take in details without even thinking about it.</p>\n<p>Computer Vision aims to teach computers to interact with the visual world. It has applications in navigation, automated inspection, medical image process, and so much more.</p>\n<p>In this talk I will do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce the field of Computer Vision.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate how to manipulate a webcam video feed and pre-process the video to perform Canny Edge Detection.</li>\n<li>Use these edges to isolate a playing card image and, eventually, identify which playing card is being shown.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No prior knowledge of Computer Vision or Machine Learning is necessary.</p>","feedback_url":"https://pyohio.typeform.com/to/Lww1J2","kind":"30-minute Talk","schedule":{"room":"Barbie Tootle","start":"2019-07-28T16:15:00"},"speakers":[{"name":"Steve Crow","speaker_id":248,"photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/069f4e1d4a89d18f9a839bdfdaa3c4bc/481ca/248.jpg","srcSet":"/2019/static/069f4e1d4a89d18f9a839bdfdaa3c4bc/481ca/248.jpg 1x,\n/2019/static/069f4e1d4a89d18f9a839bdfdaa3c4bc/05ba8/248.jpg 1.5x,\n/2019/static/069f4e1d4a89d18f9a839bdfdaa3c4bc/73cd1/248.jpg 2x"}}}}}],"youtube_url":"http://youtu.be/bYBFF-N1Z98"},"tutorials":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f5c1f38d-d34d-59ad-8955-01e89c3840b2"}}
