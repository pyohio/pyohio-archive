{"data":{"talks":{"title":"Sipping the Nectar of Amazon from the Serverless Chalice","description_html":"<p>It never seems to be the right time to enter the sweet world of microservices. Each time you use \"serverless\" in a conversation, it dies right there near the water-cooler. How do you produce a POC, tests, a build, and proper security if your teammates can’t come along? In this talk you will learn to: build, debug, validate, test, secure, and deploy with a build pipeline using a Python framework.</p>","abstract_html":"<p>You have a small piece of functionality that doesn’t elegantly fit into various domains your existing application already covers. You’re of course concerned about delivering that functionality to production, and making it securely available to the end user. All of this is followed with an “if only I could” stream of thoughts, and cautious conversations with your Ops team that don’t go anywhere beyond hypotheticals. This is a perfect time to look into a serverless framework like Chalice. In this session, we will discover the flexibility, robustness, and ease of use inherent in serverless frameworks. We will dig deeper into ways to package production level code, including security, deployment, and load considerations. We will also touch on alternatives and general concerns for such architectural decisions.</p>","feedback_url":"https://pyohio.typeform.com/to/hacUkZ","kind":"30-minute Talk","schedule":{"room":"Barbie Tootle","start":"2019-07-27T16:30:00"},"speakers":[{"name":"Ilya Gotfryd","speaker_id":102,"photo":{"local":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":250,"height":250,"src":"/2019/static/8f7a979da225e2e4ce61046ac1656ab3/481ca/102.jpg","srcSet":"/2019/static/8f7a979da225e2e4ce61046ac1656ab3/481ca/102.jpg 1x"}}}}}],"youtube_url":"http://youtu.be/MFTod36TF0Y"},"tutorials":null},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"0491211c-4c82-53ec-a70d-65f4988c1660"}}
