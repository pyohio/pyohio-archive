Statistics related to the number of cases of Autism and other speaking disorder is quite disappointing too. In recent years, researchers and scientists have successfully used deep learning to read brain signals and translate them into human-readable language like English. Hence, Deep learning has given us all the hope to provide voiceless the voice.</p>\n","type":"Lightning Talk","speakers":[{"name":"Hitesh Khandelwal","biography":"<p>Currently, I'm in my third year of under graduation, pursuing Bachelors of Science in computer science from Ashoka university, I'm interested and very much fascinated in AI, particularly in Applied Deep learning.
