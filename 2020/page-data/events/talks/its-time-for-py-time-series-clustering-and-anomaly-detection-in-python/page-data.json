But what do you do when you have hundreds or thousands of time series?</p>\n<p>Enter time series clustering. In this talk, Susan Devitt, Senior Data Scientist, will introduce two algorithms for time series clustering - Shape Based Distance and Dynamical Time Warp - implemented in the python package dtwclust. Taking a real world example using daily financial transaction data, she will show you when to consider clustering and how it can be used for anomaly detection.</p>\n","type":"Thunder Talk","speakers":[{"name":"Susan Cameron Devitt","biography":"<p>Susan has over a decade of experience in the full life cycle of data science projects from data engineering and quality assurance to model deployment, interpretation, and data visualization in a variety of industries including biotechnology, retail and oil and gas.
