In order to process large amounts of data and efficiently deal with complex operations, the Message Passing Interface (MPI) provides primitives optimized specifically to handle such cases. The increasing need for applying parallelism to applications with growing complexity, is handled through the use of MPI to scale across machines and to efficiently utilize all available resources.   </p>\n<p>In this talk, we will detail various MPI primitives and delve into their use cases that are applicable for modern-day high performance computing needs. We will explore the MPI layer in the realm of Python and define available means to utilize MPI with python.</p>\n","type":"Thunder Talk","speakers":[{"name":"Kawthar Shafie Khorassani","biography":"<p>I am a PhD student at The Ohio State University working on the MVAPICH2-GDR project in Dr. Panda's Network-Based Computing Lab.
