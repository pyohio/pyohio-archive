We'll dissect the pytz library, explain why it contains over 400 individual time zones while focusing on the 29 entries in the USA. We'll also find the reason why pytz is not part of the standard Python, why it gets updated so often and why even that won't solve all your problems. And no, PEP 615 will not save you either.\nTwo centuries of short-sighted propaganda and long-term chaos in ten minutes. Maybe that will make you want to avoid time zones in your code altogether!</p>\n","type":"Thunder Talk","speakers":[{"name":"Miroslav Šedivý","biography":"<p>Born in Czechoslovakia, studied in France, living in Germany.
