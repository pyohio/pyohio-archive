To avoid eroding developer trust in your service, we show how we guarantee strong contracts using <a href=\"https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0\">OpenAPI</a> while avoiding extraneous overhead for service owners. This talk shows how to autogenerate OpenAPI schemas, prevent breaking changes automatically with your CI/CD, and how we improved the delivery cycle time for our teams.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://zapier.com\">Zapier</a>, we connect over 5,000 of your favorite online apps together. We've learned how to produce high-quality APIs with over 10 years of experience integrating with APIs. We're applying these best practices as we break out our services from our Django monolith.</p>","type":"Short Talk","start_time":"2022-07-30T15:42:00-04:00","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/VhRonVCkoNk","speakers":[{"name":"Olmo Maldonado","slug":"olmo-maldonado"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"9c2b1e45-cce2-55cf-a1e1-7a46114323f3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2197803311","2744905544","3465997491","479044330","512359922"]}
