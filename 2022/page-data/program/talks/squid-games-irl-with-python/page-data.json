Have you ever thought about building something in real life from your favorite TV show? Josh has not either... Oh wait! He has!</p>\n<p>After binge watching “Squid Games” a little too quickly and access to too much manufacturing equipment such as laser cutters and 3D printers. He decides to ride the trend and make a gun to play Red Light Green Light from the first game of “Squid Games” in real life. Sounds scary, am I right?... Do not worry... it is not lethal... yet... Mahah...</p>\n<p>In this talk you will learn how to come up with ideas for your projects. How to source parts and a (nerf) gun for your next project with little hardware hacking and controlling that hardware in python. Learn how to design models in Fusion 360 and create rapid prototypes with a 3D printer. Lastly, create basic AI with OpenCV.</p>","type":"Short Talk","start_time":"TBD","speakers":[{"name":"Josh Martin","slug":"josh-martin"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"636b5639-25db-5ea3-9ed7-62be91339d57"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2197803311","2744905544","3465997491","479044330","512359922"]}
