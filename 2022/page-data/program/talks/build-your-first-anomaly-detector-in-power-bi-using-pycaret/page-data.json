PyCaret is a low-code, open-source machine learning library for Python, and PyCaret can be integrated within Microsoft Power BI. This empowers citizen data analysts and data scientists to add machine learning to their dashboards and reports within minutes. In this demonstration, I'll give an overview of PyCaret and outline the different ways it can be used to enrich your Power BI reports and dashboards. I'll detail the necessary set-up steps to start using PyCaretâ€™s machine learning capabilities in Power BI. Finally, I'll demonstrate how to train and implement an unsupervised anomaly detector in Power BI using PyCaret.</p>","type":"Short Talk","start_time":"2022-07-30T13:15:00-04:00","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/Wy-LAJcakD8","speakers":[{"name":"Cadey Moore","slug":"cadey-moore"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"bd28941e-c03e-5f44-be40-b8c41a7c4c28"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2197803311","2744905544","3465997491","479044330","512359922"]}
