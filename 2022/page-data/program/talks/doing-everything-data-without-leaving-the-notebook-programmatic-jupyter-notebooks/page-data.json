It makes doing tasks like data wrangling, modeling, visualizing really quick and easy for even people with not a lot of experience in software engineering.</p>\n<p>But, a problem arises that to actually put that code into production involves a lot of copying, pasting, and refactoring into order to be used in a full fledged system. But what if we didn't have to leave the notebook? What if the notebook could be the production ready code?</p>\n<p>This talk will giving an introduction to using the papermill library, how it works, why it's powerful, and an actual use case of how I use papermill in a pipeline that transforms raw data into clean tidy data, and then runs multiple many notebooks to generate various visualizations and statistics to be later used in a study.</p>","type":"Short Talk","start_time":"TBD","speakers":[{"name":"Alex Zharichenko","slug":"alex-zharichenko"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"e2f867f6-6306-5f5a-b921-11b422f65512"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2197803311","2744905544","3465997491","479044330","512359922"]}
