It's weird and written in C.<br />\nIt is also <em>incredibly</em> fast and powerful.<br />\nGraph analytics has applications across industries and sciences--more than you might expect--and we want to get the power of GraphBLAS into the hands of Pythonistas and practitioners.</p>\n<p>Our package, <a href=\"https://github.com/python-graphblas/python-graphblas\"><code>python-graphblas</code></a>, allows us to write GraphBLAS in the style of math, not the C API.<br />\nCounterintuitively, by introducing some unconventional notation, we were able to make our library more Pythonic.<br />\nHowever, <a href=\"https://github.com/python-graphblas/python-graphblas\"><code>python-graphblas</code></a> is still low-level, and most users probably won't use it directly.<br />\nInstead, most people will probably want to use <a href=\"https://github.com/python-graphblas/graphblas-algorithms\"><code>graphblas-algorithms</code></a>,<br />\na library that looks like <a href=\"https://networkx.org/\">NetworkX</a>, the most popular graph library in Python.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/python-graphblas/graphblas-algorithms\"><code>graphblas-algorithms</code></a> is young.<br />\nIt is growing and has great potential, but it could use more help.<br />\nWho can help?  Anybody who is interested!  We have a well-defined target--the <a href=\"https://networkx.org/\">NetworkX</a> API and its tests--so<br />\nit's very easy to find things to do.<br />\nWe actually find it fun like solving puzzles, and there is still a lot of low-lying fruit.<br />\nIf you don't know much about graphs or how to contribute to open-source, this could be a great way to learn!</p>","type":"Short Talk","start_time":"2022-07-30T14:57:00-04:00","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/lVkkBj6m9K0","speakers":[{"name":"Erik Welch","slug":"erik-welch"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"5c698f2d-8b35-5904-8a58-1420d6d071a2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2197803311","2744905544","3465997491","479044330","512359922"]}
