Unfortunately, many security tools do not address the vulnerabilities of APIs that run in those containers. Cloud-native applications expose many internal API services and developers are increasingly using external API services for their applications. Both internal and external API use expose the workload to new vulnerabilities; more strongly, workload security and API security are really two sides to the same coin.</p>\n<p>This talk specifically focuses on the security problems and vulnerabilities exposed through APIs, and introduces Cisco’s Panoptica, a tool for discovering, managing, and repairing these vulnerabilities, and APIClarity, Panoptica’s open source core.</p>","type":"Bonus Talk","start_time":null,"youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/7cP86Uv57N8","speakers":[{"name":"Peter Bosch","slug":"peter-bosch"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"eaeac5ce-7cf6-5ecc-84b6-22264940571a"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2197803311","2744905544","3465997491","479044330","512359922"]}
