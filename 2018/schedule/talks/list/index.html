                    <h4>lvh</h4>
                    It&#39;s no secret Python&#39;s `pickle` module is unsafe. It&#39;s also very popular, especially in the scientific Python community. Many of its users actually have pretty good reasons to use it, so just telling them not to isn&#39;t very helpful. This talk explores how Pickles are unsafe, advanced exploitation techniques, and how we can make Pickles safer without giving up on its useful properties.

                    Have you ever wanted to teach a room full of students or your colleagues? It
turns out that it is difficult to setup the infrastructure needed to deliver source code
and documentation and then assess submissions! Suitable for full-time educators
and industrialists who instruct their colleagues, this talk explains how you can teach 
programming using GitHub Classroom, Travis CI, and Python.

                    <h4>Tom Fetherston</h4>
                    Regular expressions are used to define search patterns. Python provides regular expressions via the built in ‘re’ module, but they are hard to read, write, and understand. This talk will give you two tools conquer regex’s, a mental model, (demonstrated with props), of how they work, and a mini-language, “Simple Regex Language”, to create readable regex’s that easily translate into Python regex&#39;s.

                    There is a lot of hype around machine learning, but completing a project at work seems to be much harder than what online tutorials had advertised. In this talk, I will provide a few tips for different stages of a machine learning project like recognizing pitfalls, that I wished I knew when first navigating through my projects as a junior in the field.

                    Earlier this year, in the spring of 2018, I bought a printer made in the late 80&#39;s in the parking lot of a Rax Roast Beef restaurant for $20. This started a nostalgic journey assisted by NumPy matrix slices and a can of WD-40. This talk will cover how I used Python to overcome three decades of history to get it printing again.

                    Python is a great asset to have in a developer&#39;s toolkit of languages. Although considered a scripting language, Python can create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for your applications. GUI controls can be laid out programmatically or organized using a rapid application development (RAD) tool such as Glade. Come see how to build GUIs with Python and Glade.

                    <h4>Elizabeth Wehner</h4>
                    BuzzFeed identified a need for Twitter to scrape our metadata more frequently, and worked with Twitter to build a new API that is currently in beta testing. In this talk I will go through the process of building a &quot;Twitter Scraper&quot; that accesses this new API. I will highlight various challenges encountered along the way, and show how I ultimately solved these problems.

Nothing short of a magic trick, we usually feel impressed but have no idea what just happened. This talk is an intro to containers as explained by a Python dev for Python devs, without the magic tricks.

                    Many Python projects use Sphinx for documentation, so much so that Sphinx is like Python’s secret weapon. It’s a powerful, mature system for generating static content -- not just docs, but blogs and regular websites.

Sphinx can also be customized and extended in various ways, and here the trip gets wild and wooly. This talk takes a look at themes and extensions.

                    As technology improves at a rapid rate, experimentation in the ways in which people interact with machines and computers becomes more significant. Most tools for communication are limiting as they only interact with a user on a basic level, usually on a two-dimensional plane. However, by taking advantage of new technology new interfaces can be designed in order to better interact with machines.

                    <h4>Jon Banafato</h4>
                    Passwords suck. They&#39;re often weak and reused, making them one of the least secure parts of web applications. This is such a problem that entire industries of password managers and two-factor authentication products have popped up as extra layers of security. To really address this issue and make our users and products more secure, we need a more fundamental change.

Airflow is the mechanism with which we can do this. In this talk, we will explore what Airflow is, and how we can leverage it to automate some of the tedium out of our daily lives.

                    Cloud functions -- or &quot;Serverless&quot; -- allows you to put functions into play without the typical deployment effort. While the major cloud providers have their own FaaS, OpenWhisk -- an open source solution -- allows you to run function on any cloud, including on premises. Come see how you can run Python functions on your own terms.

                    Speaking English alone won&#39;t make you a journalist or author. The same is true of Python and becoming a professional developer or open source contributor. Many people are &#39;learning to code&#39; to switch careers, but overlooking the other skills they&#39;ll need.

New developers will learn the when, why, and how of those other skills, while experienced devs can use this as a roadmap for mentoring.

Technologies covered will be the ISS Open Notify API, Twilio SMS, RQ, and RQ Scheduler.

                    When I started learning web dev, I dove into building my first Rails app. I didn’t know how it all worked, but after hours of hacking I had a blogging app running. I imagine many share a similar learning experience. Similarly, you don’t need a PhD to do deep learning, you can get started with Python skills and open-source frameworks. It can be fun and rewarding, and inspire you to dive deeper.
