Why? No code is perfect, and bugs happen! Unfortunately, many people don't write tests because they feel like it's too much work, or they don't know how to start.</p>\n<p>In this lightning talk, I'll show you how to start testing your code using <code>pytest</code>. We will cover how to configure <code>pytest</code>, where to put tests, and how to write concise yet meaningful tests. Slides will include example code with full test cases. I'll also share resources for learning more advanced techniques.
