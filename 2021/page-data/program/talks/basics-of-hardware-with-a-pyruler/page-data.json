Explore basic embedded hardware concepts with me as we use CircuitPython and a PyRuler. CircuitPython is a programming language that simplifies writing code for microcontrollers. The PyRuler is an engineering reference for sizes of various electronic components, but it's also a microcontroller board complete with LEDs, capactive touch buttons, and various inputs and outputs that let you get started designing your embedded system with little to no hardware experience.</p>\n<p>Resources: <a href=\"https://github.com/kirakirakira/python-hardware-pyruler\">Python Hardware w/ PyRuler</a></p>","type":"Thunder Talk","start_time":"2021-07-31T10:05:00-04:00","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/fZpZ1pc8Kpk","content_warnings":null,"speakers":[{"name":"Kira Hartlage","slug":"kira-hartlage"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"ea9cb05b-6972-5483-8d6b-9b2a98c4b3da"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2197803311","2744905544","3465997491","479044330","512359922"]}
