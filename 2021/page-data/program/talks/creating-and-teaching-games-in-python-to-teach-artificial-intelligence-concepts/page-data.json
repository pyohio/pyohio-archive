For the past 3 years, I have taken Artificial Intelligence classes as a student. AI is a buzz word - It is an exciting yet daunting subject. My instructor made these classes fun and less daunting by using real world examples and games. I got so inspired, I started understanding and writing neural networks in Python in no time. Now, I am trying to create the same experience for my students.</p>\n<p>I am a volunteer teacher at <a href=\"https://www.corp.aiclub.world/\">https://www.corp.aiclub.world/</a> where I teach AI concepts to students in 6th - 12th grade. When I create a course, I think of how to include AI concepts in games. I write games utilizing libraries like turtle and pygame. I consult with my instructor and they help review my courses.</p>\n<p>I would like to share my approach, give the audiences a sneak peak at my curriculum, and share some resources that I have created. </p>\n<p>Here are some examples of my curriculum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nTM4zhnyI6ZvvGffhJ6tJTJnfBGc_Hwn5Rc_3oTwOSM/edit?usp=sharing\">A Cheat Sheet I made for students</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aUIV6jAahnLCWUlGNwtWbg4ew6Q0afl3aSMgEVAaIkE/edit?usp=sharing\">TicTacToe using AI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HbtudvKDDbJNVzORYFK-6QyyY7YT7-r1OoEZtTZoVg0/edit?usp=sharing\">Stock Predictor using AI</a></li>\n</ul>","type":"Lightning Talk","start_time":"2021-07-31T14:30:00-04:00","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/eNaPGZX7Co0","content_warnings":null,"speakers":[{"name":"Anay Pant","slug":"anay-pant"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"992491be-50da-5143-bc89-7078c5e565cc"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2197803311","2744905544","3465997491","479044330","512359922"]}
