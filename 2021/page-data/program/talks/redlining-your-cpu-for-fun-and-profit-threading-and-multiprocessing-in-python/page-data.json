Enter the concurrent execution standard libraries (<code>threading</code>, <code>multiprocessing</code>, <code>concurrent.futures</code>, etc.). Throughout the talk, we will look through various toy problems and learn how we can quickly speed it up for IO bound and CPU bound processes using the Python standard library, so you can get more done and raise that CPU usage to 100%.</p>","type":"Thunder Talk","start_time":"2021-07-31T13:15:00-04:00","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/rUPIpH-mrO8","content_warnings":null,"speakers":[{"name":"Alex Zharichenko","slug":"alex-zharichenko"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"354e637e-eeba-5436-8d6f-71f90df6ae40"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2197803311","2744905544","3465997491","479044330","512359922"]}
