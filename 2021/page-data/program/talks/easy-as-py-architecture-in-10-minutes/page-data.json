It's supposed to be tricky, difficult, erudite. That's crazy.</p>\n<p>Architecture is about writing code that is effective: it's about finding your target audience, identifying what they need, and thinking about how to make it easy to do THAT. That's it.</p>\n<p>This talk is about 5 basic principles for software architecture that can be applied to projects big and small: correctness, clarity, simplicity, modularity and empathy. It's about boiling architecture down to it's bare essence - ergonomics. We'll look at these 5 principles and end up with 4 super-distilled lessons that we can apply TODAY to our code to make it better.</p>","type":"Thunder Talk","start_time":"2021-07-31T13:05:00-04:00","youtube_url":"https://youtu.be/kgUbygKhFg0","content_warnings":null,"speakers":[{"name":"JC Coto","slug":"jc-coto"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"32512497-d4d1-55e9-9e6c-b57eeb3b4615"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2197803311","2744905544","3465997491","479044330","512359922"]}
